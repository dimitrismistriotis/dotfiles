Dear TADADA,
To encrypt the whole storage drive you will indeed to perform a reinstall of Ubuntu. You can do this with the official Ubuntu ISO and then follow the instructions listed below to install any configurations specific to your system.

1) Run the commands listed below in a terminal.
$ wget -qO- repo.entroware.com | bash
$ sudo apt-get install entroware-base
2) Launch the Entroware Support Hub application, select the restore tab, and then press the restore button. Once this finishes, just reboot your system for the changes to take effect.

I hope this helps and please let us know how you get on.

Entroware Support Team,
